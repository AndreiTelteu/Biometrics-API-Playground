# New Architecture Migration Guide

## Issue Fixed: setLayoutAnimationEnabledExperimental No-Op

The `setLayoutAnimationEnabledExperimental` API is a no-op in React Native's New Architecture (Fabric). This has been resolved by migrating to `react-native-reanimated` v3.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated CollapsibleSection Component
- Replaced `LayoutAnimation` with `react-native-reanimated`
- Migrated from `Animated.Value` to `useSharedValue`
- Updated animation logic to use `withTiming` and `useAnimatedStyle`
- Maintained all existing functionality and accessibility features

### 2. Added Dependencies
- Added `react-native-reanimated: ^3.16.1` to package.json

### 3. Cleaned Up Unused Imports
- Removed unused `View` import from App.tsx
- Removed unused `clearLogs` from useStatusLogger hook

## Installation Steps

1. Install the new dependency:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

2. For iOS, install pods:
```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

3. For Android, no additional setup required with RN 0.80+

4. Restart Metro bundler:
```bash
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

## Benefits of This Migration

- ✅ Full New Architecture (Fabric) compatibility
- ✅ Better performance with native animations
- ✅ Hardware acceleration support
- ✅ Maintained all existing animation features
- ✅ Better debugging and development experience

## Verification

The CollapsibleSection component should now work properly in both:
- Legacy Architecture
- New Architecture (Fabric)

All animations will run smoothly without the previous no-op warning.
