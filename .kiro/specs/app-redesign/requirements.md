# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves a complete redesign of the Biometrics Playground app to improve user experience through collapsible API configuration sections, a modern new design system, and dark theme support with manual theme switching. The redesign aims to reduce visual clutter by allowing users to collapse configuration fields when not needed, while providing a fresh, modern interface that works seamlessly in both light and dark modes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to collapse and expand the API configuration sections so that I can focus on the sections I'm currently working with and reduce visual clutter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN the enrollment and validation configuration sections SHALL be collapsible with expand/collapse controls
2. WHEN I click on a configuration section header THEN the section SHALL toggle between expanded and collapsed states
3. WHEN a configuration section is collapsed THEN only the section title and expand/collapse indicator SHALL be visible
4. WHEN a configuration section is expanded THEN all configuration fields (URL, method, headers, custom payload) SHALL be visible
5. WHEN I collapse a section with validation errors THEN the section header SHALL indicate there are errors without showing the full error details
6. WHEN the app restarts THEN the collapse/expand state of each section SHALL be remembered and restored

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a completely new modern design for the app so that it feels fresh, contemporary, and provides better visual hierarchy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN it SHALL display a new modern design with improved typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy
2. WHEN viewing any section THEN the design SHALL use modern UI patterns including improved card layouts, better button designs, and enhanced visual feedback
3. WHEN interacting with form elements THEN they SHALL have modern styling with proper focus states, hover effects (where applicable), and clear visual feedback
4. WHEN viewing the status display THEN it SHALL use modern iconography and improved status indicators
5. WHEN viewing action buttons THEN they SHALL have modern button designs with appropriate sizing, spacing, and visual states
6. WHEN viewing the status log THEN it SHALL have improved readability with better formatting and visual separation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want a dark theme option with a manual switch so that I can use the app comfortably in different lighting conditions and match my personal preference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN there SHALL be a theme toggle switch in the header that allows switching between light and dark themes
2. WHEN I toggle to dark theme THEN all UI elements SHALL display with appropriate dark theme colors including backgrounds, text, borders, and accent colors
3. WHEN I toggle to light theme THEN all UI elements SHALL display with appropriate light theme colors
4. WHEN I switch themes THEN the change SHALL be immediate without requiring app restart
5. WHEN the app restarts THEN my theme preference SHALL be remembered and applied automatically
6. WHEN using dark theme THEN text contrast SHALL meet accessibility standards for readability
7. WHEN using either theme THEN interactive elements SHALL have appropriate hover/focus states that work well with the selected theme

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the new design to maintain all existing functionality so that I can continue to use all current features without any loss of capability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the redesigned app THEN all existing biometric operations (enroll, validate, delete keys) SHALL continue to work exactly as before
2. WHEN configuring API endpoints THEN all current configuration options (URL, method, headers, custom payload) SHALL remain available and functional
3. WHEN viewing biometric status THEN all current status information SHALL be displayed with the same level of detail
4. WHEN viewing operation logs THEN all current logging functionality SHALL be preserved
5. WHEN the app encounters errors THEN error handling and display SHALL work the same as the current implementation
6. WHEN using form validation THEN all current validation rules SHALL continue to apply

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth animations and transitions in the new design so that the interface feels polished and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN expanding or collapsing configuration sections THEN there SHALL be smooth animated transitions
2. WHEN switching between light and dark themes THEN there SHALL be smooth color transitions
3. WHEN interacting with buttons and form elements THEN there SHALL be appropriate visual feedback with smooth transitions
4. WHEN the status log updates THEN new entries SHALL appear with subtle animation effects
5. WHEN validation errors appear or disappear THEN they SHALL transition smoothly
6. WHEN the app is loading operations THEN loading states SHALL have smooth, modern loading indicators
