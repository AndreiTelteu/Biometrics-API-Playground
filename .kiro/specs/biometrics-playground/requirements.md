# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a comprehensive biometrics playground testing app that allows developers to test and validate biometric authentication functionality using the react-native-biometrics plugin. The app will provide a user-friendly interface for enrolling biometric credentials, testing authentication, and validating responses with backend endpoints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to enroll biometric credentials through the app, so that I can test the biometric enrollment process and send the public key to a backend server for registration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps the "Enroll" button THEN the system SHALL prompt for biometric authentication to generate a key pair
2. WHEN biometric enrollment is successful THEN the system SHALL display the generated public key
3. WHEN enrollment is complete THEN the system SHALL send the public key to a configurable backend endpoint via HTTP request
4. WHEN the backend request is successful THEN the system SHALL display enrollment success status
5. WHEN the backend request fails THEN the system SHALL display the error message and allow retry

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test biometric authentication and signature creation, so that I can validate the complete authentication flow with backend verification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps the "Check & Validate" button THEN the system SHALL prompt for biometric authentication
2. WHEN biometric authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL create a cryptographic signature with a timestamp payload
3. WHEN signature creation is complete THEN the system SHALL send the signature and payload to a configurable validation endpoint
4. WHEN the backend validates the signature successfully THEN the system SHALL display validation success status
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL display the error details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure API endpoints and HTTP methods, so that I can test against different backend services and environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL provide input fields for enroll endpoint URL and HTTP method
2. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL provide input fields for validation endpoint URL and HTTP method
3. WHEN endpoint configuration changes THEN the system SHALL persist the settings for subsequent requests
4. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL use the configured HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
5. IF no endpoint is configured THEN the system SHALL display a warning message before attempting requests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the current biometric sensor availability and key status, so that I can understand the device capabilities and current state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL check and display biometric sensor availability
2. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL display the type of biometric sensor (TouchID, FaceID, Biometrics)
3. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL check and display whether biometric keys already exist
4. WHEN biometric keys are deleted THEN the system SHALL update the key status display
5. IF biometrics are not available THEN the system SHALL display the reason why

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see detailed status information and error messages, so that I can troubleshoot issues during testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any biometric operation occurs THEN the system SHALL display the current operation status
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators during the request
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display detailed error messages with error codes if available
4. WHEN operations are successful THEN the system SHALL display success messages with relevant details
5. WHEN displaying status information THEN the system SHALL include timestamps for better debugging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to reset the biometric keys, so that I can test the enrollment process multiple times during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user taps a "Delete Keys" button THEN the system SHALL remove existing biometric keys from the keystore
2. WHEN key deletion is successful THEN the system SHALL update the UI to reflect that no keys exist
3. WHEN key deletion fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN keys are deleted THEN the system SHALL reset any enrollment status indicators
