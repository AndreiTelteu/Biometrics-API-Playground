# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Web Control feature provides a desktop web interface that allows users to remotely control and monitor the biometric playground app through a browser. This feature creates a local web server that serves a Postman-like interface for testing endpoints, viewing logs, and executing actions. The web interface communicates with the mobile app to perform the same operations available in the native app interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to start a web server from the mobile app, so that I can control the app remotely through a browser interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses the web control button THEN the system SHALL start a web server on a random available port
2. WHEN the web server starts THEN the system SHALL listen on 0.0.0.0 to accept connections from any network interface
3. WHEN the web server is running THEN the system SHALL display the server URL and port in the mobile app
4. WHEN the user wants to stop the server THEN the system SHALL provide a stop button that terminates the web server
5. IF the selected port is unavailable THEN the system SHALL automatically try another random port

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a Postman-like web interface, so that I can easily test and interact with biometric endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the web interface THEN the system SHALL display a desktop-only interface similar to Postman
2. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL provide tabs for validation and enrollment endpoints
3. WHEN the user selects an endpoint tab THEN the system SHALL display relevant configuration options and controls
4. WHEN the user configures endpoint parameters THEN the system SHALL provide the same customization options available in the mobile app
5. IF the user accesses from a mobile device THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating desktop-only support

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute biometric operations through the web interface, so that I can test functionality without using the mobile app directly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks an action button in the web interface THEN the system SHALL execute the corresponding operation in the mobile app
2. WHEN an operation is executed THEN the system SHALL display the API output in the web interface
3. WHEN an operation completes THEN the system SHALL show the response data, status, and timing information
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display error details and stack traces in the web interface
5. WHEN multiple operations are running THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests appropriately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view real-time logs in the web interface, so that I can monitor app activity and debug issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web interface is active THEN the system SHALL display real-time logs from the mobile app
2. WHEN new log entries are generated THEN the system SHALL automatically update the log display without page refresh
3. WHEN the user wants to clear logs THEN the system SHALL provide a clear logs button
4. WHEN the user wants to filter logs THEN the system SHALL provide filtering options by log level or content
5. WHEN logs become numerous THEN the system SHALL implement scrolling and limit display to recent entries

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want bidirectional communication between the web interface and mobile app, so that all operations work seamlessly across both interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user performs an action in the web interface THEN the mobile app SHALL execute the same operation as if triggered locally
2. WHEN the mobile app state changes THEN the web interface SHALL reflect those changes in real-time
3. WHEN configuration is updated in either interface THEN both interfaces SHALL synchronize the changes
4. WHEN the mobile app is closed THEN the web server SHALL automatically shut down
5. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL handle disconnection gracefully and attempt reconnection

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want basic authentication on the web interface, so that unauthorized users cannot access the control panel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the web interface THEN the system SHALL prompt for HTTP Basic Authentication
2. WHEN the web server starts THEN the system SHALL generate a random 6-digit password
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL use "admin" as the username and the generated password
4. WHEN the password is generated THEN the system SHALL display it in the mobile app interface
5. WHEN invalid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL return a 401 Unauthorized response
6. WHEN valid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL grant access to the web interface

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the web interface to support all current biometric operations, so that I have full feature parity between web and mobile interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses validation endpoints THEN the system SHALL provide all validation configuration options available in the mobile app
2. WHEN the user accesses enrollment endpoints THEN the system SHALL provide all enrollment configuration options available in the mobile app
3. WHEN the user customizes API parameters THEN the system SHALL support all parameter types and validation rules from the mobile app
4. WHEN the user views API responses THEN the system SHALL format and display the same data structure returned by the mobile app
5. WHEN new features are added to the mobile app THEN the web interface SHALL be easily extensible to support them
